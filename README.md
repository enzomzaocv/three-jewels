# Three Jewels Matching Game

For [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) I thought it would be fun to write an easy game.

What better game than a three jewel matching game, easy, simple, and we can add an unlimited amount of
power-ups and other fun stuff, so we can constantly be adding new features to it.

To start we're going to keep it super simple. No OpenGL or No fancy game loop.
Just a JPanel with Graphics2D and Timer to update the graphics.

As for input, we'll use out of the box mouse listeners for drag-and-drop detection.

Happy hacking!
